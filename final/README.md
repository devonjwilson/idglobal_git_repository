I'm excited to have developed the website to this point! As I discussed with Connor during office hours, during a J-Term class I created a wire-frame for the type of Website I'd like to create (but had no web-design skills to do so - it only existed in Powerpoint). For this final project, I set to work trying to create that website from scratch. 

I created a index.html and worked with the front end formatting a good bit, so the top section could include our logo and a definition image. I created a horizontal scrolling format so multiple projects could be added and the user could scroll to the side to see them.
Then using Views.py, I created individual pages for our different project pages.

Within our models - I created an email sign up so the site could have interested viewers add their email. I utilized Javascript so that a pop-up notification would arise, telling the viewer they had successfully signed up. I used a layhout.html and block body format so the form and navigation bar could be seen across pages.  

I'm happy to say that I showed the page to my boss today and she said she'd like to use it, so the next step is to work on launching it! Thanks so much to Connor and all of the TA's who helped me on this final, and a number of office hours across the semester!
